# UCC-1 Liens and Residential Solar

A **UCC-1 lien** is a public filing that gives a lender or third party a secured interest in property.
In residential solar, UCC-1 filings are commonly used with **solar loans, leases, or third-party financing**.

While often misunderstood as “normal,” UCC-1 liens can create serious issues in real estate transactions.

## Why UCC-1 Liens Are a Problem for Homeowners

When a UCC-1 lien is filed in connection with a solar system, it can:

* Interfere with **mortgage underwriting**
* Delay or block **refinances**
* Complicate **home sales**
* Reduce **buyer confidence**
* Create confusion about what is owned versus financed

In many cases, buyers and lenders discover UCC-1 filings **late in the transaction**, creating closing risk.

## Solar Loans vs. Clear-Title Solar™

Not all solar installations are equal.

**Traditional solar financing** often:

* Uses a separate loan
* Files a UCC-1 lien
* Treats solar as personal property
* Competes with the first mortgage

**Clear-Title Solar™**, by contrast:

* Avoids UCC-1 liens entirely
* Treats solar as real property
* Aligns with mortgage rules
* Preserves resale and refinance flexibility
