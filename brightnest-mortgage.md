# BrightNest Mortgage™

BrightNest Mortgage™ is the mortgage-based financing framework created by QuiqNest to integrate solar directly into homeownership.

Unlike traditional solar loans, leases, or add-on financing, BrightNest Mortgage™ treats solar as **real property**, not consumer debt.

## What BrightNest Mortgage™ Does

BrightNest Mortgage™ allows solar to be:

* Integrated **at purchase or refinance**
* Rolled into the **primary mortgage**
* Financed without creating a second lien
* Structured to preserve **clear title**

This approach ensures solar increases home equity instead of creating resale or refinancing friction.

## Core Principles

BrightNest Mortgage™ is built on four non-negotiables:

* **Clear-Title Solar™**
  No UCC-1 liens. No third-party solar debt.

* **Mortgage Rule Alignment**
  Solar must comply with FHA, FNMA, and standard mortgage guidelines.

* **Pre-Purchase Intelligence**
  Solar feasibility is evaluated *before* a buyer commits to a home.

* **Equity Creation**
  Solar is treated as an asset that strengthens the mortgage, not a liability layered on top.

---

## How It Fits Together

BrightNest Mortgage™ works in conjunction with:

* **Solar-Ready Home™ assessments**
* **Clear-Title Solar™ standards**
* Approved installers and mortgage-safe system sizing

Together, these components enable **Pre-Purchase Solar Integration**.
