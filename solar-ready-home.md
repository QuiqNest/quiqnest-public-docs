# Solar-Ready Home™

A Solar-Ready Home™ is a property evaluated for solar feasibility **before purchase or refinance**.

The assessment determines whether a home can support solar in a way that:
- Preserves clear title
- Avoids UCC-1 liens
- Aligns with mortgage rules
- Protects resale value

Solar-Ready Homes™ are evaluated using:
- Roof geometry and orientation
- Shading and obstruction analysis
- Utility usage data (when available)
- Local code and mortgage constraints

This allows buyers, homeowners, lenders, and realtors to understand solar potential **before committing to a transaction**.
