# Clear-Title Solar™

Clear-Title Solar™ is a mortgage-based solar ownership standard created by QuiqNest.

Unlike traditional solar loans or leases, Clear-Title Solar™ ensures that:

- The homeowner owns the solar system outright
- No UCC-1 lien is filed against the property
- No third-party solar debt interferes with the mortgage
- The solar system is treated as real property, not consumer debt

Clear-Title Solar™ is designed to protect:

- Homebuyers
- Homeowners
- Lenders
- Realtors
- Property resale value

This standard enables solar to be integrated **before purchase or refinance**, turning solar into home equity instead of a liability.
